        <h2>Favorite Foods</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
              <h3>Omelettes</h3>
              <p>I have always loved cooking. One of the first things I learned how to make was an omelette. I have curated my skill over the year, and have managed to come up with a method that creates the best omelette ever. Last semester, I made a video on my omelette making process in order to share the wealth of deliciousness.</p>

          </li>
          <li>
              <h3>Pasta</h3>
              <p>My favorite kind of pasta is chicken and broccoli alfredo. Unfortunately, I recently had to go on a gluten free diet. I've had to adjust to leaving my favorite foods behind. Luckily, my friends and family have helped me find the best substitutes so I can still enjoy my favorite foods, such as pasta. I have found out that the <a href="https://www.barilla.com/en-us/product-results/pasta/range/gluten-free?sort=alpha&page=1" target="_blank">Barilla Gluten Free pasta</a> is the best substitute when it comes to still wanting that authentic taste.</p>
          </li>
          <li>
              <h3>Fruit</h3>
              <p>I know fruit is pretty vague in terms of it being a favorite food. I love a ton of different kinds of fruit. I used to live on a tropical island, so fresh fruit was always something I had in my diet. I miss being able to go outside and pick mangoes off the trees. I feel like it is hard to get good fruit from the grocery store, but when it comes straight off of the tree, fruit is one of my favorite foods.</p>
